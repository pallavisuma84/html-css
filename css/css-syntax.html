	<h1>ABOUT EIFFEL TOWER</h1>
	<h2>history of eiffel tower</h2>
	<p>&quot;The Eiffel Tower is a landmark and an early example of wrought-iron construction on a gigantic scale. It was designed and built by the French civil engineer Gustave Alexandre Eiffel for the Paris World’s Fair of 1889. The tower, without its modern broadcasting antennae, is 984 ft high. The lower section consists of four immense arched legs set on masonry piers. The legs curve inward until they unite in a single tapered tower. Platforms, each with an observation deck, are at three levels; on the first is also a restaurant. The tower, constructed of about 7000 tons of iron, has stairs and elevators. A meteorological station, a radio communications station, and a television transmission antenna, as well as a suite of rooms that were used by Eiffel are located near the top of the tower&quot;</p>
	<h2>construction of eiffel tower</h2>
	<p>&quot;Eiffel’s work combined expert craftsmanship and graceful design. Completed in 1884, it was for a time the highest bridge in the world, winning Eiffel’s factory a worldwide reputation for excellence. Eiffel cast Frederic Auguste Bartholdi’s colossal statue Liberty Enlightening the World, which was dedicated in New York in 1886. Soon after, he began work on his greatest project, the building of the Eiffel Tower. It was completed in 1889 for the celebration of the centennial of the French Revolution (1789-1799). Eiffel was not a popular man when he started building the huge steel-frame tower that would overlook Paris. The structure was just too different and the critics didn’t like it at all. In 1887, the leading artists of Paris signed a petition to have what they regarded as a monstrosity torn down immediately. Fortunately for Paris, their call was ignored. And though Parisians didn’t like it at first, they began to grow fond of the structure they initially called a Cyclops and a skeleton. The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889, just in time to show off for the World’s Fair, being held that year in Paris. The tower was also a sign of things to come. Eiffel was taking full advantage of a new building material, structural steel. With it he took the first step in creating what would become the modern skyscraper.The imposing tower-constructed of 7,000 tons of iron in 18,000 parts held together by 2,500,000 rivets rises to a height of 984 ft and continues to dominate the Paris skyline. In the early 1890’s Eiffel gave up the daily management of his business and became absorbed in the new science of aerodynamics&quot;</p>
